# Notes

The smxapp is just an .Rmd shiny template. One can obtain it via RStudio by:

```
File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From template -> smx dashboard
```

It depends on the {xe} and {mardata} packages, the installation guide for those is provided in the [README file](https://heima.hafro.is/~einarhj/pkg/xe). Additional information is provide in the top 2 code chunks in the shiny template (loaded as indicated above).
