# Communicating with hafvog

## Preamble

{xe} allows seamless connection to the MRI Oracle XE-database via R. Unlike the mar-database the XE-database resides on personal computers and is what the software **hafvog** communicates with. The XE-database has at minimum one schema - hafvog. This schema contains all cruises that are visible in the hafvog-software. Normally (now defunct) an additional schema is included in the XE-database - fiskar. This contains a copy of most tables that are stored in schema fiskar in the MRI Oracle mar-database.

The {xe] is supposed to mimic a proportion of the functional calls that reside in {mar}


## Installing:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("fishvice/xe",  dependencies = FALSE, args='--no-multiarch')
```

# Basic functionality

Once an R session is started the connection to xe is done via:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ROracle)
library(xe)
con <- connect_xe()
```

To access the data in the hafvog-schema (i.e. the cruises currently visible as "Leidangrar" in the Hafvog-software) one simply does:
```{r}
st.sql <- lesa_stodvar(con, schema = "hafvog")
le.sql <- lesa_lengdir(con, schema = "hafvog")
nu.sql <- lesa_numer(con, schema = "hafvog")
```

To take a peek of what variables are in the data use the `glimpse`-funtion. E.g. 
```{r}
glimpse(st.sql)
```

If one is interested in working with the data in schema fiskar one simply does:
```{r}
st.sql <- lesa_stodvar(con, schema = "fiskar")
le.sql <- lesa_lengdir(con, schema = "fiskar")
nu.sql <- lesa_numer(con, schema = "fiskar")
```

Take note that in the above the objects xx.sql are not yet local R-dataframes, just an sql-script that also gives a peek at the first 10 records in the database. To create a local dataframe one can import the data via the collect-function. E.g.

```{r}
st <- st.sql %>% collect(n = Inf)
```

In general things then should work the same as in the mar-package, except that lon and lat in the station-table are still in the DDMMmm-format. Here one could use the `geoconvert`-function from the geo-package.


# Working with survey data

Here is an example on how one would get the spring survey data from the database into R.

First we provide and import from schema hafvog:

```{r}
st.sql <- 
  lesa_stodvar(con, "hafvog") %>% 
  filter(synaflokkur == 30)
le <-
  st.sql %>% 
  select(synis_id, ar) %>% 
  left_join(lesa_lengdir(con, "hafvog")) %>% 
  collect(n = Inf)
nu <- 
  st.sql %>% 
  select(synis_id) %>% 
  left_join(lesa_numer(con, "hafvog")) %>% 
  collect(n = Inf)
kv <- 
  st.sql %>% 
  select(synis_id, ar) %>% 
  left_join(lesa_kvarnir(con, "hafvog")) %>% 
  collect(n = Inf)
st <- 
  st.sql %>% 
  collect(n = Inf)
```
